# Weather Image Classification Project

## Objective

The Weather Image Classification Project aims to classify weather images into categories such as sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and TensorFlow. This project demonstrates various machine learning techniques, including data augmentation, model training, and evaluation.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in implementing machine learning models using Keras and TensorFlow.
- Understanding of CNN architecture and its application in image classification.
- Ability to perform data augmentation to improve model generalization.
- Enhanced knowledge of model training, validation, and evaluation.
- Development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills through practical machine learning challenges.

### Tools Used

- Python for programming the CNN and its operations.
- Keras and TensorFlow for building and training the neural network.
- Google Colab as the development environment for running the notebook.
- Google Drive for storing the dataset.
